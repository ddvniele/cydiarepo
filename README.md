# Dan's Repo
this is my open source cydia repository which contains all the tweaks I've made so far.

## Add to your package manager
- Add https://ddvniele.github.io/cydiarepo to your package manager
  - You can also import them automatically to Cydia, Sileo, Zebra or Installer opening the link

## Tweaks
These are the tweaks you can find on my repo:
- Nothing here for now. Publishing tweaks as soon as possible. :)

## Next Goals
- Collecting and adding all the tweaks I've made during the past years
- New restyled website for repo and tweaks depictions
- So much more! These features are still a work-in-progress.

### Thanks to
I'd like to thank so much [supermamon](https://github.com/supermamon/), and in particular his project [Reposi3](https://github.com/supermamon/Reposi3), which I forked to do this. :)
